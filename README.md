Misc social media investigation and analysis tools, mostly geared toward Twitter bot detection

The Automating OSINT Master Course https://register.automatingosint.com/ was invaluable in teaching the Twitter API code for these.

bot_username_entropy.py: uses Tweepy and Streaming API to log Twitter accounts with usernames exceeding a set Shannon entropy threshold (i.e, those potentially generated by algorithm rather than a human)

prune_twitter_accounts.py: scrub a list of accounts of any inactive or suspended ones

initial_retweets.py: experimental script to look for bots in real time based on the early retweeters of a target account

compare_term_frequencies.py and term_frequency.py: the results of some early tinkering with text mining
